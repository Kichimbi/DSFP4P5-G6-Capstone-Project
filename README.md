## Business Problem 


## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to utilize advanced time series analysis methods, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM models, to analyze fuel price data for super, diesel, and kerosene provided by the EPRA. The specific objectives of this project are:



## Data Understanding 

The Dataset consists of fuel prices sourced from Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority(EPRA) https://www.epra.go.ke/services/petroleum/petroleum-prices/ and US Dollar Exchange Rate source Central Bank of Kenya https://www.centralbank.go.ke/rates/forex-exchange-rates/. 

The dataset consists of the following columns;

**EPRA Dataset**

*__Date__: This column records the date of the data entry.

*__Towns__: This column lists various towns.

*__Super__: This column refers to the price of 'Super' grade fuel.

*__Diesel__: This column refers to the price of 'Diesel' grade fuel.

*__Kerosene__: This column refers to the price of 'Kerosene' grade fuel.

**CBK Exchange Rate Data**

*__Date__: This column records the date of each exchange rate entry.

*__Currency__: This column specifies the foreign currency for which the exchange rate is given.

*__Mean__: This column shows the average exchange rate for the specified currency on the given date. 

*__Buy__: This column indicates the buying rate of the currency.

*__Sell__:This column shows the selling rate of the currency.

## Project Structure
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing - Resampling, Testing for Trends, Diffencing, Decomposition, Train-Test Split, Checking for best ARIMA & SARIMA Orders
3. Modelling - ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet & LSTM (Long Short - Term Memory)
4. Model Evaluation - using MAE and RSME
5. Deployment

## Results

### Super Price Forecast

### Diesel Price Forecast

### Kerosene Price Forecast



## Model Deployment 

## Summary 

### Recommendations


### Limitations
